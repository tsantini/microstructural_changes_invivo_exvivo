This repository aims to share data from the article titled "Investigating Microstructural Changes Between In Vivo and Perfused Ex Vivo Marmoset Brains Using Oscillating Gradient and B-Tensor Encoded Diffusion MRI at 9.4T" by Tales Santini, Alyson Shim, Jr-Jiun Liou, Naila Rahman, Gabriel Varela-Mattatall, Matthew D. Budde, Wataru Inoue, Stefan Everling, and Corey A. Baron, currently under review at MRM journal.

Here is the folder structure for this repository (under development):

- `01-Camino_waveforms`: Diffusion gradient waveforms used in the Monte-Carlo simulations performed with the command `datasynth` from the Camino package (http://camino.cs.ucl.ac.uk/)
